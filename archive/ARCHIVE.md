# Archived Legacy Files

This directory contains the original files from the initial add-on implementation that used an external Docker image (hihp/wsdd).

These files are preserved for reference but are no longer used by the add-on. The add-on has been restructured to build its own Docker image with wsdd.py fetched directly from the upstream source.

## Files

- `addon.json` - Original add-on metadata (deprecated format)
- `config.json` - Original configuration file (before restructure)
- `README.md` - Original README describing the external Docker image approach
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Original changelog (before restructure)
