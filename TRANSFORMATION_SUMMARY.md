# Transformation Summary

This document provides a summary of the transformation from a basic add-on configuration to a complete Home Assistant add-on repository.

## What Was Done

The repository has been successfully transformed into a valid Home Assistant add-on repository following the problem statement requirements:

### 1. Add-on Structure (ws-discovery/)
All add-on files are now properly organized in the `ws-discovery/` directory:
- **Dockerfile**: Builds a custom image that fetches wsdd.py from christgau/wsdd at commit e9325b5ce312423f9b83f7175949694097a161b2 for deterministic builds
- **build.yaml**: Defines base images for multi-architecture support (amd64, aarch64, armhf, armv7, i386)
- **config.json**: Add-on configuration schema (removed external Docker image reference)
- **run.sh**: Startup script using bashio to read configuration and launch wsdd
- **README.md**: User-facing documentation for the add-on
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history for the add-on

### 2. Repository Configuration (repository.yaml)
Created at the repository root with metadata for Home Assistant to recognize this as an add-on repository.

### 3. Archived Legacy Files (archive/)
Original files from the previous implementation preserved for reference:
- addon.json (deprecated format)
- config.json (original version using external Docker image)
- README.md (original documentation)
- CHANGELOG.md (original version history)
- ARCHIVE.md (explanation of archived files)

### 4. Deterministic Builds
The Dockerfile fetches wsdd.py from a specific commit (e9325b5ce312423f9b83f7175949694097a161b2) ensuring reproducible builds.

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Root README.md updated to describe the repository structure
- Root CHANGELOG.md updated with v1.1.0 release notes
- STRUCTURE.md added for maintainer reference
- .gitignore added to prevent temporary files from being committed

## Validation Performed

✅ config.json validated as proper JSON
✅ repository.yaml validated as proper YAML
✅ build.yaml validated as proper YAML
✅ run.sh bash syntax validated
✅ Dockerfile syntax verified
✅ wsdd.py successfully fetched from specified commit
✅ wsdd.py help output verified
✅ Code review completed (no significant issues)
✅ Security scan completed (no vulnerabilities detected)

## Commit SHAs Referenced

The problem statement mentioned branch commit SHAs:
- d0a647702a83... (initial add)
- 118ca5522871... (archive)

These specific SHAs were not found in the current repository, which suggests they may be part of the planning process or in another branch. The implementation is complete and functional regardless.

## Maintainer Action Items

### Required:
- Review all changes in this PR
- Test the add-on in a Home Assistant instance

### Optional:
1. **Embed wsdd.py**: For a fully self-contained add-on, you can download wsdd.py and embed it in the repository instead of fetching during build. See STRUCTURE.md for details.

2. **Add icon.png**: Add a 256x256 pixel icon to ws-discovery/ for display in the Home Assistant add-on store.

3. **Additional architectures**: The build.yaml includes common architectures, but you can add or remove based on testing.

## Testing the Add-on

To test this add-on:

1. Add this repository to Home Assistant:
   - Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store
   - Three dots menu → Repositories
   - Add: `https://github.com/hotchkj/Home-Assistant-WSD`

2. Install the WS-Discovery add-on

3. Configure and start the add-on

4. Check the logs for proper operation

5. Verify Windows computers can discover the server

## Questions or Issues

If you have questions about this transformation or prefer different implementation choices:
- The wsdd.py fetch can be replaced with an embedded file
- The architecture list can be adjusted
- The configuration options can be expanded

All design decisions were made to align with Home Assistant add-on best practices while maintaining the functionality of the original implementation.
